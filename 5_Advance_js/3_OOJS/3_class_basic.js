// Class is syntactic sugar over prototyped model added in ES6 (2015)
// internally prototyped model is executed for us 

// Why it comes ?
    // -> because many developer comes from different language backgournds like 
    //    C++, java etc. Where class based model is very famous

    static banches = 15;

// creating object
