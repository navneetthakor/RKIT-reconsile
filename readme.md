- Supports all major borwsers but, internet explorer 11 and down are not supported.
- What new it has compare to older versions is,
    - switech to ```Javascript``` instead of ```JQuery``` and because of that,
        - improved performance, as now the this size of javascript code needed to load is reduced.
