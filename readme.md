# Bootstrap 5

## Intoduction
- It's latest version of bootstrap
- Supports all major borwsers but, internet explorer 11 and down are not supported.
- What new it has compare to older versions is,
    - switech to ```Javascript``` instead of ```JQuery``` and because of that,
        - improved performance, as now the this size of javascript code needed to load is reduced.
        - Better DOM interection due to use of native javascript methods which are more efficient compare to JQuery.
    - Added new componentes

## Ways to use Bootstrap
- Include it from ``` CDN (Content Delivery Network) ``` as follow4
    - CSS
    ```
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-EVSTQN3/azprG1Anm3QDgpJLIm9Nao0Yz1ztcQTwFspd3yD65VohhpuuCOmLASjC" crossorigin="anonymous">
