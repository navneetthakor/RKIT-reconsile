// JQuery is built for 'selecting' element and performing 'action' on them 

/*
syntax is: 
    $('selector').action()

    -> $        : to access JQuery or it defines JQuery
    -> selector : to locate HTML element. It uses CSS selectors, that's why accessing perticular element is so easy
    -> action   : that will perform on element
