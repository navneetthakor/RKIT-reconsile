//how to place handlers for event
/* 
-> JQuery have followsing syntax
    1) $(selector).action(function(){})
        -> where action is the event in our case.
        -> For an example:
            $('div').click(function(){
                // write code here
            });

    2) $(selector).action()
        -> this not attaches any event handler to the elements
            instead it programatically fires the event (here action is event)
        -> For an example:
            $('div').click(); 

*/


//'on()' method
//-> on method attaches on or more event handlers
//-> It has following ways 

  //  1)
    $("p").on("click", function(){
        // write code here...
    });

 //   2)
    $('div').on({
        click: function(){
            // code here
        },

        mouseenter: function() {
            // code here
        }
    })
