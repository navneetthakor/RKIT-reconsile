//Taking input from user ---- 
//->type casting is very useful in C#, becuase to take input from user we have to use 
Console.ReadLine();
//which always returns String
//therfore type conversion becomes very important in this language 

//for and example: 
int sampleInt = Convert.ToInt32(Console.Readline());
//-> if input is not appropriate then System.FormateException will be thrown
